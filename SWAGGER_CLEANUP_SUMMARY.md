# Cleaned Up Member API Structure

## 🎯 **SWAGGER ORGANIZATION COMPLETED**

### **✅ ACTIVE MEMBER APIs** (Organized under "Member APIs" tag)

#### **Member Registration & Payment Flow:**
- `POST /memberships/payfirst/orders` - Create payment order
- `POST /memberships/payfirst/confirm` - Confirm payment 
- `POST /memberships/payfirst/register` - Complete user registration
- `GET /memberships/payfirst/status/{orderId}` - Check payment status
- `POST /memberships/payfirst/check-mobile` - Check mobile for payments

#### **Member Management:**
- `GET /memberships/public/availability` - Check seat availability

#### **Admin Member Management:**
- `GET /memberships/payfirst/admin/pending` - List unpaid registrations
- `POST /memberships/payfirst/admin/complete/{orderId}` - Complete registration manually

---

## 🗑️ **DEPRECATED APIs** (Moved to "DEPRECATED APIs" tag)

#### **Old Payment System:**
- `POST /memberships/payments/orders` - ❌ Old payment creation
- `POST /memberships/payments/confirm` - ❌ Old payment confirmation

#### **Old Registration System:**
- `POST /memberships/public/register` - ❌ Disabled, returns 410 error

## 📱 **RECOMMENDED USER FLOW**

### **For New Members:**
```
1. Check Availability → GET /memberships/public/availability
2. Create Payment → POST /memberships/payfirst/orders  
3. Complete Payment → POST /memberships/payfirst/confirm
4. Register User → POST /memberships/payfirst/register
5. Get Status → GET /memberships/payfirst/status/{orderId}
```

### **For Returning Users:**
```
1. Check Payment → POST /memberships/payfirst/check-mobile
2. Complete Registration → POST /memberships/payfirst/register
```

## 🔧 **SWAGGER DOCUMENTATION CHANGES**

- ❌ Complex registration options

### **After Cleanup:**
- ✅ **"Member APIs"** - All active member endpoints
- ✅ **"DEPRECATED APIs"** - Old endpoints clearly marked
- ✅ Consistent naming and organization
- ✅ Clear pay-first flow documentation
