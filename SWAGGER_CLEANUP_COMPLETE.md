## 🚀 **MIGRATION GUIDANCE:**

### **For Developers Still Using Old Endpoints:**

**Old Payment Endpoints (now undocumented):**
```javascript
// ❌ DON'T USE - Undocumented
POST /memberships/payments/orders
POST /memberships/payments/confirm

// ✅ USE INSTEAD - Documented & Recommended
POST /memberships/payfirst/orders
POST /memberships/payfirst/confirm
```

**Old Registration Endpoint (returns 410 error):**
```javascript
// ❌ DON'T USE - Returns error with migration guide
POST /memberships/public/register

// ✅ USE INSTEAD - Complete pay-first flow
POST /memberships/payfirst/orders → /confirm → /register
```

**Removed:** "Memberships Public" and "Memberships Payments" sections
**Result:** Clean, focused API documentation with only useful endpoints
